- [#126](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/126) [`544e01e`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/544e01e34ac25d68fd3f06a70856ece6d1f01cf5) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - Updated the code to consider the boolean's truth and falsity names wherever the `enums` attribute is used.

- [#126](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/126) [`544e01e`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/544e01e34ac25d68fd3f06a70856ece6d1f01cf5) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - The `shortStyle` configuration flag was replaced by the more generic `clusterPrefix`, which allows cluster arguments anywhere in the command line.

- [#126](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/126) [`544e01e`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/544e01e34ac25d68fd3f06a70856ece6d1f01cf5) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - In addition to the `COMP_LINE` and `COMP_POINT` environment variables, the parsing methods now read default values of the command line and completion index from the `BUFFER` and `CURSOR` variables, respectively.

- [#126](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/126) [`544e01e`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/544e01e34ac25d68fd3f06a70856ece6d1f01cf5) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - Replaced the ANSI escape code `\x9b` by the more traditional `\x1b[`, in order to support terminals that do not recognize the former. Fixed the `getArgs` procedure to support word completion in PowerShell.

- [#126](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/126) [`544e01e`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/544e01e34ac25d68fd3f06a70856ece6d1f01cf5) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - Refactored the parser to ignore command-line arguments coming after the completion index.

  For example, the invocation `cli --help cmd` would throw the help of the `cmd` command, if it exists. If not, or if it does not have a help option, the argument may still be used as an option filter, if the `useFilter` attribute is set.

  The nested command may also enable filtering in its help option definition. For example, the invocation `cli --help cmd -f` would throw the help of the `cmd` command, filtered by the pattern `-f`.

### Minor Changes

- [#101](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/101) [`5b0eb88`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/5b0eb882daaf3798d5d2a7cc3c88e35542c72977) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - Added the `skipCount` attribute to function options to indicate the number of remaining command-line arguments to skip after returning from the execute callback.

- [#101](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/101) [`5b0eb88`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/5b0eb882daaf3798d5d2a7cc3c88e35542c72977) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - Added the `ConnectiveWords` enumeration to be used together with the `connectives` property of the validator configuration, in order to customize the formatting of option requirements.

- [#101](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/101) [`5b0eb88`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/5b0eb882daaf3798d5d2a7cc3c88e35542c72977) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - Removed the `parseDelimited` attribute in anticipation for a new and better feature yet to be implemented. This parsing callback was not really important, whereas the same effect can be achieved with the `parse` callback by modifying the previous option value.

  Improved the formatting of custom phrases for both error and help messages. Now they can contain multiple groups referencing the same phrase alternatives across groups. This also allowed the help item phrases to use specifiers for different value data types.

  Added a new kind of validation, `invalidNumericRange`, for the option's numeric range definition. Some other enumerators were merged into one that uses a phrase containing different format specifiers for each alternative.

  Refactored the `ul` enumeration into a constant that holds underline styles instead of underline colors (since it had just one color that was not strictly necessary).

- [#101](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/101) [`5b0eb88`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/5b0eb882daaf3798d5d2a7cc3c88e35542c72977) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - Added new attributes for the boolean option: `truthNames`, `falsityNames` and `caseSensitive`.

It specifies a value that is used if the option is specified in the command-line without any parameter.

- [#101](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/101) [`5b0eb88`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/5b0eb882daaf3798d5d2a7cc3c88e35542c72977) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - Added the `paramCount` attribute to the function option, to specify the number of parameters that the option expects in the command-line. New enumerators, `invalidParamCount` and `variadicWithClusterLetter`, were added to `ErrorItem`, that are used by the validator when validating the new attribute. The formatter was updated to take this attribute into account when rendering the description of variadic options.

- [#101](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/101) [`5b0eb88`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/5b0eb882daaf3798d5d2a7cc3c88e35542c72977) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - Added a `breaks` property to help sections, to specify the number of line breaks to insert before a section. Added the `required` and `comment` properties to the usage section, to specify options that should be considered required in the usage, as well as to append a commentary to the usage, respectively. The demo was updated to include multiple usage sections.

- [#101](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/101) [`5b0eb88`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/5b0eb882daaf3798d5d2a7cc3c88e35542c72977) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - The `validate` method now returns a list of warnings. The validator was updated to detect naming inconsistencies in the option definitions and report them as warnings.

As a consequence, it no longer supports a synchronous parsing method.

  A new kind of validation, `invalidRequiredValue`, was implemented for the verification of required option values in the case of options that are either always required or have a default value.

The loop itself was refactored to accumulate a sequence of arguments that will be passed to the parsing callbacks as the option parameter(s). The `parseError` enumerator was removed from the `ErrorItem`, since it is no longer supported.

Added the `required` and `comment` properties to the usage section, to specify options that should be considered required in the usage, as well as to append a commentary to the usage, respectively. The demo was updated to include multiple usage sections.

## 0.4.0-dev.2

### Minor Changes

- [#95](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/95) [`9d26e81`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/9d26e81eabf3fb8ebe46c35e3419b7e1d5f46e3e) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - Added new attributes for the boolean option: `truthNames`, `falsityNames` and `caseSensitive`. They can be used to configure how option parameters are converted to boolean.

- [#96](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/96) [`464c113`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/464c1136aa32767618eacfca685ff054b99d6b0b) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - Added the `paramCount` attribute to the function option, to specify the number of parameters that the option expects in the command-line. New enumerators, `invalidParamCount` and `variadicWithClusterLetter`, were added to `ErrorItem`, that are used by the validator when validating the new attribute. The formatter was updated to take this attribute into account when rendering the description of variadic options.

- [#92](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/92) [`34c6d5e`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/34c6d5efa202bcc09213727f624f0f208409bd55) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - The parsing callbacks were refactored to accept a single parameter of type `ParseInfo`, which contains information about the current argument sequence in the parsing loop.

- [#81](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/81) [`8070da4`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/8070da460bef3ad735cd638228283eaa71a1ba50) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - Removed the `parseDelimited` attribute in anticipation for a new and better feature yet to be implemented. This parsing callback was not really important, whereas the same effect can be achieved with the `parse` callback by modifying the previous option value.

  Improved the formatting of custom phrases for both error and help messages. Now they can contain multiple groups referencing the same phrase alternatives across groups. This also allowed the help item phrases to use specifiers for different value data types.

  Added a new kind of validation, `invalidNumericRange`, for the option's numeric range definition. Some other enumerators were merged into one that uses a phrase containing different format specifiers for each alternative.

  Refactored the `ul` enumeration into a constant that holds underline styles instead of underline colors (since it had just one color that was not strictly necessary).

- [#88](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/88) [`b46a609`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/b46a609d116167496b7ddce2a1a21ef98cee47ba) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - Added the `fallback` attribute for non-niladic options. It specifies a value that is used if the option is specified in the command-line without any parameter.

- [#84](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/pull/84) [`4c2587a`](https://github.com/trulysimple/tsargp/commit/4c2587a27142dd308549c8a788e66c9823ecb558) Thanks [@disog](https://github.com/disog)! - The parser was refactored to more easily handle asynchronous callbacks.

Added the following properties to `HelpConfig`: `sections`, `styles` amd `misc`. Removed some attributes from the help option which are not needed anymore. (We will _not_ go through a deprecation process, since the library is under active development and not currently used by other packages.)

Accordingly, new methods were added to the parser class, that you can use to check for these messages. Here is a list of what was introduced in this change:

  - `TerminalMessage` - base class for other message types
  - `WarnMessage` - represents a warning message (e.g., for a deprecated option)
  - `CompletionMessage` - the list of completion words
  - `VersionMessage` - the version (currently, it's just a string)
  - `ArgumentParser.doParse` - the most flexible method to parse arguments
  - `ArgumentParser.tryParse` - a convenience method that catches any error before returning

  Removed the `OpaqueArgumentParser` and `CastToOptionValues` as they are not needed anymore. Instead,
  you can use `ArgumentParser` or `OptionValues` with no template argument.

Added the `shortStyle` configuration property to the parser configuration, to indicate that the first command-line argument is expected to be an option cluster. These two must be used in conjunction.
